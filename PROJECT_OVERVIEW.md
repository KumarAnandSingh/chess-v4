- **Chat system** with message history and quick messages
- **Spectator mode** support with live game viewing
- **Game state persistence** and recovery
- **Player authentication** and session management
- **ELO rating system** with automatic updates

### ✅ Enhanced Features
- **Reconnection handling** for network interruptions
- **Game state recovery** after disconnection with grace periods
- **Comprehensive error handling** with structured responses
- **Rate limiting** for security and abuse prevention
- **Health monitoring** endpoints with detailed metrics
- **Performance logging** and monitoring
- **CORS configuration** for production deployment
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Graceful shutdown** handling

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/priyasingh/chess-v4/backend

# Using the startup script (recommended)
./start.sh

# Or manually
npm install
npm start

# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev
```

The server will start on **port 3001** (configurable in .env).

## 🔗 API Endpoints

### Room Management
- `POST /api/rooms/create` - Create new room with invitation code
- `POST /api/rooms/join` - Join room with code
- `GET /api/rooms/:code` - Get room information
- `GET /api/rooms` - Get all active rooms
- `DELETE /api/rooms/:code` - Delete room (creator only)

### System Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check with metrics
- `GET /` - Server status and feature list

## 🎮 Socket.IO Events

### Room Events
- `create_room` - Create private room
- `join_room` - Join room with code
- `leave_room` - Leave current room
- `room_updated` - Room state changes

### Game Events
- `authenticate` - User authentication
- `join_matchmaking` - Random game matching
- `make_move` - Chess move execution
- `resign` - Game resignation
- `draw_offer` - Draw offers/acceptance
- `chat_message` - In-game chat

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Rate limiting** on all endpoints and operations
- **Input validation** with detailed error messages
- **Session management** with automatic cleanup
- **CORS protection** for cross-origin requests
- **Error sanitization** (no stack traces in production)
- **Performance monitoring** to detect issues

## 📊 Monitoring & Health

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "activeRooms": 5,
  "activeSessions": 12,
  "activeGames": 3,
  "memory": { "rss": 52035584, "heapTotal": 18923520 },
  "version": "4.0.0"
}
```

### Logging Levels
- **Error**: Critical failures and exceptions
- **Warn**: Rate limits and unusual conditions
- **Info**: User actions and game events
- **Debug**: Detailed debugging information

## 🎯 Room Code System

### Format: `[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{2}`
- **AB12** - 2 uppercase letters + 2 numbers
- **XY99** - Case-insensitive matching
- **Collision detection** with automatic retry
- **24-hour expiration** with cleanup

### Example Flow
1. Player creates room → Gets code "AB12"
2. Player shares "AB12" with friend
3. Friend joins with code "AB12"
4. Game starts automatically when 2 players present
5. Spectators can join anytime

## 🔄 Game Flow Integration

### Room-Based Games
1. **Create** → 4-digit code generated
2. **Share** → Code shared with opponent
3. **Join** → Opponent enters code
4. **Play** → Real-time chess with chat
5. **Spectate** → Others can watch live

### Matchmaking Games
1. **Queue** → Join by time control/rating
2. **Match** → Automatic pairing
3. **Play** → Same features as room games

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Deployment Features
- **Environment configuration** via .env
- **Health monitoring** endpoints
- **Graceful shutdown** handling
- **Memory usage** tracking
- **Performance** logging
- **Error recovery** mechanisms

### Scalability Preparation
